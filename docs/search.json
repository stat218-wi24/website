While I won’t be assigning grades specifically for this subject, I encourage you to explore and assess your progress in achieving these objectives. Additionally, you can learn more about sustainability topics by coming to my office or reaching out to ask.\nBelow, I’ve included Cal Poly’s definition of sustainability and its associated learning objectives. I am planning to integrate 1st and 4th learning objectives specifically.\nCal Poly defines sustainability as the ability of the natural and social systems to survive and thrive together to meet current and future needs. In order to consider sustainability when making reasoned decisions, all graduating students should be able to:\n1. Define and apply sustainability principles within their academic programs,\n2. Explain how natural, economic, and social systems interact to foster or prevent sustainability,\n3. Analyze and explain local, national, and global sustainability using a multidisciplinary approach,\n4. Consider sustainability principles while developing personal and professional values.\n\nImage by Freepik"

Below you will find brief descriptions of the types of assignments in this course.\n\nWeekly Assignments\nYou will have assignments every week, typically consisting of 3-4 daily assignments per week. Please upload them collectively, using a format like ‘Week X Assignment Name Surname’.\nThese assignments are individual assignments to track your learning progress. You can do these assignments either using your PC/Laptop/iPad/Chromebook or solve them to your notebook. Either way, you should upload them to Canvas. All weekly assignments are due Sundays at 11.59 pm.\n\n\nLab Assignments\nWe will have 7 lab sessions, each followed by a corresponding lab assignment. Lab sessions will be conducted in groups, and the lab assignments will also be group projects. This means that you will submit your lab assignments as a group. Each group is composed of 3-5 students to work and complete the labs together both in the class and after the class.\nThe due dates will be determined based on the day of the lab sessions, and I will provide advance notice of these deadlines.\nImportant: Please refrain from including the names of group members who did not participate. In the event of absent students, they must either complete the lab assignment individually or coordinate with their group members to complete it together as a group project. Once the groups are determined, NO CHANGES ARE ALLOWED without prior notification to the instructor.\n\n\nExams\nExams are to be taken without the use of textbooks or notes. It is expected that you will take exams as per the scheduled times. In cases of extraordinary circumstances like illness, a family loss, please inform me before the examination.\nYou won’t be required to computer for the exams, but you may see some questions that involve filling in missing information, interpreting provided R outputs, or selecting the appropriate code to complete a task.\nHere are the due dates of exams and projects:\nMon, Feb 5: Midterm Exam (Individual, In-class)\nThu, Feb 29: Midterm Project (Group submission on Canvas)\nSat, Mar 16: Common Final Exam (Individual) - TBD\nTue, Mar 19: Final Project (Group submission on Canvas)\n\n\nProjects\nThe overarching goal of the projects in this course is to empower life science students by cultivating a profound  sense of agency. This involves actively engaging with the learning process, making informed decisions, and taking ownership of your academic journey. Through the selection of your unique data set, you will have the opportunity to construct a personalized case study, formulate research questions, employ diverse statistical procedures, and effectively communicate your findings. This hands-on approach not only enhances your understanding of the subject matter but also nurtures a proactive and self-directed approach to learning.\nMidterm Project: In this midterm project, you will select your own dataset from  OpenIntro Data Sets  or another suitable source. If your group members share the same major, it’s recommended to choose a dataset related to your field of study.\nThe project will involve applying various statistical procedures covered in our course. For detailed instructions, refer to the template on your Canvas page.\nFinal Project: In this final project, you will select your own dataset from  OpenIntro Data Sets  or another suitable source. If your group members share the same major, it’s recommended to choose a dataset related to your field of study.\nThe project will involve applying various statistical procedures covered in our course. For detailed instructions, refer to the template on your Canvas page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYour final project grade is composed of following components:\n\nFinal Project: 75 points\n\nProject Peer Evaluation: 20 points\n\nSelf-Reflection Paper: 5 points\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendance/Participation\nRegular attendance is expected from all students to maintain the quality and quantity of their work. In essence, your attendance plays a crucial role in your ability to succeed in every type of assessment conducted in our class, as consistent absences may interrupt your learning and indirectly impact your grades.\nI will record attendance during every lecture, not for grading purposes, but to track your learning progress in this class. In case of recurring absences, I will reach out to understand the reasons and work together to find solutions. If you fail to attend over 50% of classes and neglect to submit more than 50% of weekly assignments and lab assignments without prior notification, you may receive a  WU \nIn brief, you must be present in class (both physically and mentally) unless you have an  “Excusable” Reason for Missing Class . Please contact with me in advance if you are not coming and do your best to catch up what we have done in that day. You can also schedule a virtual appointment if you have questions about the missing class you had.\n\n\n\nLate Submission Policies\nI am using Dr Robinson’s late work policy for this class. This quotation below was taken from her syllabus.\n“We are living through a challenging time with unique, unusual circumstances. I do not want class deadlines to cause you extreme stress or anxiety. I offer 3 “grace days” – days to turn in the assignment late without a penalty.”\nThese can be used ONLY on homework assignments and lab assignments (a single group member must be willing to use one of their grace days for the entire group), but NOT exams or group midterm/final projects. These “grace days” can be used all at once on a single assignment or used on separate assignments throughout the quarter. Simply add a comment on the assignment in Canvas and send me an email to let me know you how many “grace days” you want to use on the assignment.\nAfter the expiration of your ‘grace days,’ a 10% grade reduction will be applied for each day that the assignment is overdue. Late submissions will not be accepted after one week from the original due date. Resubmitting assignments is not allowed. Please ensure timely completion to avoid any complications.\n\nAutomatic Canvas Settings\nCanvas is set up to automatically input 0% for missing assignments (as an incentive to go complete the assignment) and apply the 10% grade deduction policy. I will need to manually adjust your grade when you use your grace days, so it is important for you to leave a note on your assignment and email me. You are responsible for double checking your grade.\nIf you find yourself with extenuating circumstances beyond the defined late policy, please email me before the due date."

    "text": "Learning thrives in an environment built on trust and respect. The subsequent actions undermine academic integrity, creating obstacles to effective learning:\n\nAllocating less time than necessary for a satisfactory job.\nSkipping readings or neglecting non-graded activities.\nclicking through course information without thoroughly reviewing resources.\n\nWhile these behaviors can impact your grade and learning experience, they are personal choices. On the other hand, certain actions go beyond mere ‘choices’ and breach academic regulations and even legal boundaries. These include:\n\nPlagiarizing text by directly copying from websites, blogs, other discussions, or published texts.\nRecycling an essay or project previously submitted for another class.\nEngaging in dishonest practices during a test or project.\nCopying directly from another student or source without proper attribution.\nPurchasing or replicating an essay or project from an online source.\n\nIt’s crucial to familiarize yourself with the Cal Poly definitions of Cheating and Plagiarism. Take a moment to read this page and understand these concepts.\nIf you’re uncertain about citing a source, incorporating a quote, or acknowledging someone in your summaries, I’m here to assist. We can arrange a brief Zoom or in-person meeting, or I can provide feedback on a draft. Writing rules can be confusing; let’s clarify them together!\nOn the downside, the college doesn’t differentiate between breaking rules intentionally or unintentionally—the consequences remain consistent. In my class, the first instance of misquoting, misrepresentation, or copy/pasting requires a redo of the work and a one-on-one meeting with me. Upon a second occurrence, we meet again, but you won’t be allowed to redo the assignment, receiving a zero for that grade. For a third instance, you will not pass the class. Let’s take a proactive approach! If you’re unsure about citing, don’t hesitate to ask!"
